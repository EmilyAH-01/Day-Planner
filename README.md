DESCRIPTION:
This Day Planner webpage uses the Moment.js library to pull the current date and time; the date is displayed at the top of the calendar, and the time is used to color-code the planner's time slots as past, present, and future. When the user enters text into a time slot and clicks the corresponding save button, the text is saved in local storage and will persist upon page re-load.
